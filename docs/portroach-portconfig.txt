Details of the PORTROACH variable
---------------------------------

- Consists of key:value pairs, and whitespace between.
- Don't bother using the variables unless you intend to maintain
  them, otherwise portroach's accuracy will degrade rather than improve.
- Don't forget to double up $'s if you use them, to prevent make(1) from
  mangling regexes (if in doubt, verify the output of 'make -V PORTROACH')
- Each of these variables (keys) can be used only once per port.
- Restrictive variables should be avoided, most ports won't even
  need any intervention.
- Ports containing embedded version numbers (e.g. tcl84) are automatically
  restricted. - i.e., only distfiles matching tcl 8.4.x will be allowed
  (unless the current distfile differs)
- Any regexes or limitations below apply to just the version, not the
  whole distfile name.

Keys
----

site:   Tell portroach to look at one specific page or site for downloads,
        rather than looking through MASTER_SITES.

        Example: site:http://www.example.net/downloads.php

        Apache index pages or FTP directories are ideal for this.

limit:  Tell portroach to reject any new versions unless they match this
        Perl regular expression.

        Example: limit:.*[acd]$$

        (new versions must end in a, c, or d.) - note the $$ in place
        of $.

skipb:  Skip versions that look like beta or RC. This is on (1) by
        default. Set to 0 to disable. If the port's version already
        looks like a beta release, portroach will accept betas
        irrespective of the state of this variable.

        Example: skipb:0

skipv:  Comma-separated list of versions to ignore.

        Example: skipv:1.1,1.9

limitw: Limit one part of the version number to either even or odd
        numbers. This variable is in the form "number,[even|odd]"
        The (number+1)th version component will be limited.

        Examples:

         limitw:1,even      # Accepted versions: 1.0.1.13.9.8
                            #                    1.2.6
                            #                    12.4.3d
                            # Rejected versions: 2.5.2
                            #                    5.5
                            #                    8.9

         limitw:0,odd       # Accepted versions: 1.1, 3.2
                            # Rejected versions: 2.0, 6

ignore:  Set to 1 to tell portroach not to do any version checking at
         all. Useful if, say, a particular port is not going to be
         updated ever again, yet portroach still finds files that look
         like updates.
